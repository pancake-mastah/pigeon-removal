# pigeon-removal

This is a repository that helps me survive pigeons in my hometown. If you suffer from pigeons excreting on yyour car and balcony, download both the files, and just run it. The best file is trained model to detect pieons on a custom dataset. The run.py file uses the model in real time and makes a loud noise whenever a pieon comes in the field of view of the used camers.
